# Heart Disease Dataset 
Heart disease, or cardiovascular disease (CVD), is the leading global cause of death, responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year—about 32% of all deaths. CVDs include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, and other conditions. Four out of five CVD deaths result from heart attacks or strokes, and one-third occur prematurely in people under 70.

This dataset was created by merging five previously independent heart-disease datasets. We integrated them using 11 common features, resulting in the largest combined heart-disease dataset available for research. The target feature to predict from the features is death from heart disease.
