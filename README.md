# Heart Disease Dataset 
Heart disease, or cardiovascular disease (CVD), is the leading global cause of death, responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year—about 32% of all deaths. CVDs include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, and other conditions. Four out of five CVD deaths result from heart attacks or strokes, and one-third occur prematurely in people under 70.



**Challenge**: Can you build a predictive model which can assist medical practitioners in predicting high likelihood of progressing to heart disease from a patients daata, good luck !
